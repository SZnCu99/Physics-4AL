# Physics-4AL
All the lab reports written for Physics 4AL labs in 2019 Spring at UCLA

Though I cannot precisely recall the scores of these labs, all of them scored above 90 out 100.
I took this lab with the TA Jiwen Zhang. He is totally awesome and gave me a lot of helpful guidance when writing the reports.
Take him if you can!

I received A+ in this course.

Note that the syllabus for physics 4al is completely changed, so the labs presented here may no longer be useful for reference.
